This website displays products and their categories from Northwind database using ASP.NET Core and MVC Pattern. On the homepage, using the navigation bar you have 4 options, those being Home, Products, Register, and Login. The Products page shows every product along with its category name, supplier's company name, the name of the product, its price, and the stock available. The Register page allows you to input your email and desired password, then gives you a register confirmation screen. The Login page gives you the option to input your username and your password and offers options for password recovery "forgot password" and a link to the register page. Both the login and the register page are partial services and there is a blurb on either page explaining so, as external authentication is not being used on this website. The Home page features a carousel of photos each having a view button that allows you to view the category ID, category name, and a short description of each category. Below the carousel there are options to search the product database by country or price.
